# AWS Cloud Security Fundamentals  
Secure AWS Account Baseline – Skills & Competency Demonstration

## Purpose of This Project

This project was created to **demonstrate my practical skills and competencies in cloud security and governance**, rather than theoretical knowledge or isolated labs.

It showcases how I:
- Identify cloud security and governance risks
- Design proportionate, real-world controls
- Implement those controls using AWS native services
- Validate and evidence security posture through monitoring and compliance

The environment reflects how I would approach securing an AWS account in a professional setting, balancing security, auditability, and cost awareness.
